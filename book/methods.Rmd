# Methods

- Basic Mathematical Construction

- Distribution Choice
  - Weibull
  - ?Lognormal
  - ?Loglogistic 


- Stratification == Frailty
  - Traditional regression methods would presume a shared fixed effect for the shape or scale of the distribution.

- Heavy Truncation -> Estimation Problems

- Considerations for how deal with data recording, what to record and why?
	- Failure autopsy, sensors or maintenance testing
	- Continuous monitoring (economically impractical)
