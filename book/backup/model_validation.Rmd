# Model Validation

Here we describe how models can be selected.
- Log-likelihood and Deviance Checks
	- DIC as a model comparison tool
		- May not be entirely adequate due to a small quantity of available covariates when used in this or similarly informational sparse domains.

- C-index and Predictive Performance

- Quantify closeness to the true model and optimality of the current model.
- Model averaging
- Increased flexibility of model class
