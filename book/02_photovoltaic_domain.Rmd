## Solar Industry

Altering the global energy mix is essential to the future evolution of our civilization and possibly our survival as a species. Currently, the global energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels. Approximately, 82% of global energy consumption remains the product of coal, natural gas and petroleum\cite{EIAOutlook2016}. A century of heavy reliance on these non-renewable fossil fuels as the central source of energy has had severe ecological and socio-economic consequences. Locally, there have been countless instances of environmental damage, such as air\cite{Tatlow2016} and groundwater\cite{Schlanger2014} contamination and oil spills\cite{OilSpills2015}. Additionally, regions rich in fossil fuels are destabilized as wealthy nations seek to guarantee future supply\cite{Solnit2015}. Globally, the prospect of catastrophic climate change looms large, with implications including rising sea levels\cite{Davenport2015}, ocean acidification\cite{Feely2008}, crop failure\cite{Parry2004} and the economic devastation of a bursting carbon bubble\cite{Carrington2013}. 

Despite these persistent consequences, a reduction in consumption is highly unlikely. Global energy demand is projected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. As of  2012, global demand was estimated at $5.8\cdot 10^{20}$ Joules and is expected to rise by 48% to $8.6\cdot 10^{20}$ by 2040\cite{EIAOutlook2016}. The majority of this increase is the product of higher demand for electricity, which will increase by 70% before 2040. The majority of this new demand, roughly 87%, is expected to come from countries in the developing world\cite{OECD2015}. Due to their economic conditions, these countries will undoubtedly utilize whichever energy source is cheapest, regardless of the consequences. 

In this context, alternative energy production, sourced from renewable resources, is required to evade a future of socio-economic instability and ecological collapse. Fortunately, an increasing number of alternatives are being developed with the support of governments. Solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and fusion have all seen major investments over the past decade. In 2015 alone, renewable power capacity received twice the investment compared to new projects based on fossil fuels\cite{FrankfurtSchool2016}. Of these projects, wind and solar appear the most likely to become viable within the next decade\cite{OECD2014}. 

The contribution of solar energy is particularly attractive as its supplies are not limited by resource availability. At least for the next five billion years, solar energy is expected to reach the earth without interruption. Furthermore, the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the earth is several orders of magnitude higher than global energy consumption\cite{Goldemberg2000}. Given such potential, it is not surprising that the rate of installations of solar systems has increased exponentially in the past decade\cite{EPIA2014}. 

The central drivers of this growth have been continued technological development and innovative government policy. In terms of technological development, three major factors contribute to growth. First, the continued improvement of efficiency of end-use technologies. This ensures that electrical output is utilized optimally by the time it reach consumers\cite{Wilson2012}. Second, the reduction in cost and enhancement of energy storage technologies\cite{IRENA2015}. This ability is particularly important for the solar energy industry as production fluctuates based upon the availability of sunlight. Finally, and most importantly, the reduction of costs associated with technologies that convert solar energy into electricity.

In terms of reducing costs and optimizing production, the advances continue. There are regular invention of novel materials which enable broader capture of solar radiation\cite{Shi2015}. As well as developments that optimize power processing systems, ensuring that energy produced can be efficiently transfered back to the power grid\cite{Weckx2014}. These technological improvements have led to a substantial decrease in the costs associated with photovoltaic power. The average weighted utility-scale solar photovoltaic installation cost has more than halved in the last five years\cite{IRENA2016}.

However, further cost reductions are needed. The central bottleneck for greater expansion of solar power continues to be economic self-sustainability. In most markets, solar is not yet able to compete with other forms of energy generation without  government policy incentives\cite{OECD2011}. These usually come in the form of subsidies or feed-in tariffs that provide solar companies with long-term contracts for energy above market value. These are meant to provide stability as well as offset the cost of further technological development\cite{Couture2010}. However, these subsidies are reduced incrementally by design, as they are meant to serve as a temporary incentive to promote cost-saving innovation. As the subsidies are reduced, the industry is more subject to market forces and more reliant on its own ability to optimize its efficiency. The current low price of oil and coal, coupled with fickle government support for renewable energy\cite{FrankfurtSchool2016} present a difficult status quo\cite{Hals2016}. 

While technological innovation is likely to continue to reduce costs, there are avenues for further optimization given the current infrastructure. Among them are improvements in reliability, specifically in photovoltaic systems. Reliability has been a long-standing challenge\cite{Petrone2008} and a particularly important one given systems long payback periods\cite{NEEDED}. Innovation in components and manufacturing are methods for addressing reliability, but other more immediate options exist. Among them, optimized maintenance activities have the potential to dramatically reduce costs. Yet, these optimizations require accurate predictions about the state of component health. To do this, predictive maintenance is required.

## Predictive Maintenance

Predictive maintenance is generally defined as the process of using direct monitoring of conditions, efficiency and other indicators to determine the health and likelihood of failure of a system. These results indicate when maintenance tasks should be performed\cite{Mobley2002}. Informally, predictive maintenance is an activity geared toward indicating the degree of wear of a piece of equipment and predicting its useful life\cite{Levitt2011}. In doing so, it empowers organizations with the ability to plan and act against operational hazards. This additional time allows for corrective actions to be prepared including the ordering of parts and materials, often at lower prices, coordinating labor and scheduling downtime. In turn, this allows the business, not the environment, to dictate when service interruptions occur.

Check the introduction, see if the evolution of predictive maintenance described there needs to be expanded, do so if you think that is right, maybe use a gray box 

Something along the lines of:
> The rapid evolution of predictive maintenance owes much to the rapid expansion of network connectivity in most consumer products. 
> A few things have, one is the fact that they no longer stop production to inspect, because they have better data capture technologies
> The other is that as a result of those data capture technologies, shorter intervals of monitoring are possible
> So you won't run a big vibrational test every 3 months, rather you'll have a vibration sensor sending out data hourly
> predictive maintenance activities were limited by the availability of data. Vibrational analysis, thermography, fluid analysis and electrical monitoring.
-->

All predictive maintenance processes attempt to address one or more of the following three generic use cases\cite{Uz2016}. First, is fault identification. Accurately identifying the source of failure of a particular system is essential to developing effective corrective countermeasures. Second, is near-term failure probability. This permits immediate operational risks to be addressed and avoided. Third, and finally, is estimation of residual lifetime. This allows both short and long-term operational risks to be taken into account. All the cases are overlap and should not be treated as mutually exclusive. Yet, each requires slightly different considerations, methodology and inputs when developing a predictive maintenance process.

The preconditions for the development of a predictive maintenance process differ depending on the domain and selected use cases. Yet, there is a common core of needs including the ability to implement results, high data quality and a typical set of maintenance related sources. 

The ability implement a corrective mode of action is universal requirement. Without the ability to act, no amount of information derived from a predictive model will be of any value. After all, predictive maintenance does not, in and of itself, improve the reliability of operational systems, only maintenance activities do\cite{Levitt2011}. 

As predictive maintenance depends on condition monitoring, data sources of a suitable quality are required. Ideally, data sources should be historical, abundant, balanced, relevant and noiseless. Models that generate predictions about the future require historical data from which to derive patterns about operating conditions. The more historical information is recorded, the greater the opportunity of the model to observe the system along its lifetime. This in turn results in more accurate predictions about future health. Furthermore, the more abundant the data sources the better. As a greater number of repeated observations provides a greater certainty about the state of a system at any given time. Yet, in this context, historicity is of greater importance than abundance. It is possible to be tracking a large quantity of systems, but only for a short period of time. This would be inadequate due to a natural imbalance in the data for this type of process. Even in systems with profoundly poor reliability, healthy observations will greatly outnumber failures. Without a greater quantity of historical data, failures are even less likely to be present in the data. Therefore, a degree of balance is required in the data between the number of observed failures and healthy observations. Additionally, data sources must be relevant to the task. Data sources should be taken advantage of which offer the greatest potential for predictive power. Domain knowledge from subject matter experts should be exploited to provide a contextually appropriate selection. These experts should also implement mechanisms that ensure data sources are as free as possible from measurement error, missing values and other forms of noise. While unavoidable in a practical setting, noise can undercut the reliability of models and introduce a greater degree of uncertainty in predictions.

<!-- Better Segway needed -->

A typical set of data sources for a predictive maintenance process includes system attributes and conditions, maintenance logs and failure history\cite{Uz2016}. 

Attributes are a set of static values that define the identity of the system. This includes elements such as a system's ID, model number, date of installation, location, a list of components as well as any other technical specifications that might be relevant to its reliability. As these attributes are unlikely to change over time, they provide context which allows for the comparison of systems with one another. 

Conversely, conditions are temporal values that define the state of a system at specific points in time. These values are captured through telemetry from sensors or other periodic observations. They can include, but are not limited to, component status, system yields, environmental conditions or any other time-varying data directly related to system reliability. These conditions are meant to capture the evolution of the system as it ages and provide the degradation pattern leading up to failure. 

Maintenance history logs contain all service interactions with any particular system. These time stamped logs should contain any inspections, identify suspicious or replaced components and provide a listing of any corrective activities that maintenance teams performed. This data is crucial in providing context for the health of any system over time. It not only allows for the determination of the efficacy of maintenance tasks but also improves the ability better understand the sequence of events leading up to a system breakdown.

Finally, failure history records the time and conditions of observed breakdowns across systems. These values are usually encoded manually upon system failure. An accurate and timely declaration that a machine has failed and the cause of that failure is central to the task of predictive maintenance. A generic recording of failure, without determining the cause, is not sufficient. Utmost care must be taken to ensure that the failure history records are current and complete. Delays in recording failure times can detrimentally impact predictive performance. This is likely the single most important data source for a predictive maintenance process. If recorded inaccurately, it will undo the entire endeavor.

The irony is that what I'm doing is actually somewhere between two and three

Richard, [28.06.16 02:14]
because given my limited access to data (which is a precondition of this thesis), you're never going to get accurate predictions on residual lifetimes

Richard, [28.06.16 02:15]
so I am compromising, I'm interested in concordance of the population of lifetimes rather than accurate estimating each individual lifetime

### Photovoltaic Inverter Context

"A PV system is composed of PV modules and balance-of-system (BOS) components. The BOS components include the array structure, passive or active trackers, connectors, ac and dc wiring, overcurrent protections, disconnects, interconnects, inverters, charge controllers, MPPT controllers, energy storage devices, and system controllers."



Lack of trained maintenance workers is a constraint on the industry.

This thesis will focus on a data-centric approach to improving the current state of solar systems, namely data-driven maintenance.

It is in this area of cost reduction that statistical modeling and predictive maintenance can play a role. 

Still a high potential for cost reduction in the domain.

This has increased the availability of low-cost technologies to convert solar into electricity, 

Drivers of this growth have been continued technological innovation that reduce cost for the conversion of solar energy into electricity

This makes it an incredibly attractive resource

but it is one that depends far more on innovation, both technologically and in policy to 

Still solar faces a series of large challenges

The viability of these alternatives is large part due to 


Yet, the size and breadth of conventional generation capacity makes it difficult to displace without technological and policy incentives. 


These investments allow for these projects to increasingly compete with fossil fuels. 


The size and breadth of conventional capacity makes it difficult to displace existing generation methods. 


Alternative energy production, sourced from renewable resources, coupled with a decarbonization of electrical production, is crucial to reducing the aforementioned consequences. 

Fortunately, an increasing number of cleaner alternatives are being developed.

Data of Sufficient Quality

Abundant
- The more the better
Historical
- Observe as much of the lifetime of a system as possible.
- For example, even if we have a million devices being observed, if they are only observed for a short period of time, it will be difficult to generate accurate predictions about the device's end of life. 
Diverse
- Data should provide as many observations as possible for the different states of the machine. Normal operating conditions are more likely to be observed. The conditions leading up to failure are required and will almost certainly be the minority of observations.
Relevant
- Data should be relevant to the use case under study. The
Noiseless
- The more data the better. A greater quantity of data implies a greater number of observation of the system in different conditions, reducing overall uncertainty. Ideally, we would prefer this data lack measurement error, missing values or other forms of noise.
