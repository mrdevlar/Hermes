# Analysis


Feature engineering is often thought of as the dark art in statistical modeling and machine learning. Few formally teach the topic because it is often domain-specific and non-generalizable. Yet, in the context of informational sparsity, feature engineering is a uniquely important aspect of the entire process. The ability to derive as much meaningful information from the 

As discussed in the domain chapter, the majority of the data in a photovoltaic system is contextual and time invariant. Such as information about the inverter type, its park and the length of its operation. In an ideal case, the system also produces some time-dependent data, such as the output, maintenance history and some park-level weather data. This data tends to be noisy, prone to error but, more importantly, if fed into a model directly without some transformation will produce poor predictions.

	- Failure autopsy, sensors or maintenance testing
	- Continuous monitoring (economically impractical)


We can either be concerned with the modeling of hazard or with the modeling of median residual lifetime. As the hazard formulation is easier to evolve into a complex model we will use it. 

Time is not the cause. Time is correlated with the cause. Accumulation of wear on the device.

Any two systems with the same covariates values at the same time should have the same risk.

The first feature that distinguishes time-to-event analysis from traditional statistical methods is a lack of normally distributed errors.\cite{Guo2010} Time is always positive quantity, this alone should invalidate the normal error model. However, more compelling is the notion that the rate of survival distribution does not necessarily have to have a single mode. For example, when examining the survival time of individuals following a difficult surgical procedure, one would expect to see two groups of deaths. One shortly after the procedure, possibly due to complications, and a second group of deaths long after if the reason for the surgery reoccurs. This type of bimodality is unable to be properly modeled using standard OLS regression.

The second distinguishing feature is incomplete observation, or censoring, which obscures the time until an event occurs. For example, when analyzing the time until failure of an industrial device, it is often impractical to wait until all the devices in the population have failed before drawing conclusions. Therefore, the data we utilize gives us only a partial view of the duration until the event occurs in the population. Censoring comes in various classes and types, depending on the segment of time is unobserved. Right censoring is the most common class, and refers to the situation where the event is observed only if it occurs prior to some pre-specified time.\cite{Klein2003} In our case, we only observe a photovoltaic inverter failure if it has occurred in the past. Our prespecified time, is this moment, and all functioning inverters are thus right censored.
