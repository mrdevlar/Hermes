3. Domain Knowledge - Photovoltaic Inverter
	- Low information, limited economic resources
	- High reliability problem

- Describe the state of the industry as still subsidy-fueled, and why predictive maintenance is needed. 
- Describe a basic photovoltaic system
- Describe why the situation is different for photovoltaic plants compared to other energy sources. e.g. Information sparcity.
- Describe the failure mechanism a.k.a. The failure mode
	- Note that infant mortality is not part of the failure mode
	- Early failures are considered right censored at the time of failure
	- Potentially resolved through either two different models, one for early failure and mode failure, or some form of mixture model.
- Describe the explanatory variables
	- Manufacturer
	- Site
	- Location
	- Noisy Alarm
	- Qty of Lab Tests

## Solar Industry

Altering the global energy mix is essential to the future evolution of our civilization and possibly our survival as a species. Currently, the global energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels. Approximately, 82% of global energy consumption remains the product of coal, natural gas and petroleum\cite{EIAOutlook2016}. A century of heavy reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels as the central source of energy has had severe ecological and socio-economic consequences. Locally, there have been countless instances of environmental damage, such as oil spills\cite{OilSpills2015}, air\cite{Tatlow2016} and groundwater\cite{Schlanger2014} contamination. Additionally, regions rich in fossil fuels are destabilized as wealthy nations seek to guarantee future supply\cite{Solnit2015}. Globally, the prospect of catastrophic climate change looms large, with implications including rising sea levels\cite{Davenport2015}, ocean acidification\cite{Feely2008}, crop failure\cite{Parry2004} and the economic devastation of a bursting of the carbon bubble\cite{Carrington2013}. 

Yet, despite these persistent consequences, a reduction in consumption is highly unlikely. Global energy demand is projected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. In 2012, global demand was estimated at $5.8\cdot 10^{20}$ Joules and is expected to rise by 48% to $8.6\cdot 10^{20}$ by 2040\cite{EIAOutlook2016}. The majority of this increase is the result of higher demand for electricity, which will increase by 70% before 2040. The majority of this new demand, roughly 87%, is expected to come from countries in the developing world\cite{OECD2015}. 

Countries, which due to their economic conditions, are likely to leverage any available energy source. 

The majority of that output being used to further the industrialization of the developing world.  
, driven primarily by industrialization in developing nations
