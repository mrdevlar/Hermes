# Photovoltaic Domain

<!-- 
3. Domain Knowledge - Photovoltaic Inverter
	- Low information, limited economic resources
	- High reliability problem

- Describe the state of the industry as still subsidy-fueled, and why predictive maintenance is needed. 
- Describe a basic photovoltaic system
- Describe why the situation is different for photovoltaic plants compared to other energy sources. e.g. Information sparcity.
- Describe the failure mechanism a.k.a. The failure mode
	- Note that infant mortality is not part of the failure mode
	- Early failures are considered right censored at the time of failure
	- Potentially resolved through either two different models, one for early failure and mode failure, or some form of mixture model.
- Describe the explanatory variables
	- Manufacturer
	- Site
	- Location
	- Noisy Alarm
	- Qty of Lab Tests
