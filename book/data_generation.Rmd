# Data Generation

Data is generated using a life table like in classic demographic research. There are several reasons for this approach. First, it introduces time discretization which is a consideration in any real data set. This is in contrast to the model itself, which treats time as a continuous phenomena. 

Second, it allows for the specification of a population that has an arbitrarily defined hazard. This makes the output substantially more realistic than generating the data from a known parametric distribution (such as a Weibull or Lognormal). 

Third, it allows for the introduction of deviations

Finally, as the data is 

Inverse transform sampling of the cdf of the life table is used to generate values. 



It is possible to make an argument that piecewise constant hazard is
