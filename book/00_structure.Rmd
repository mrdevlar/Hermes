## General Structure

1. Introduction
	- General Summary of entire thesis
3. Domain
	- Intro: Energy is important!
	- Solar Industry 
		- Industry driven by shrinking subidies for the last decade
		- Requirement to optimize operations as much as possible given the limited resources at their disposal 
		- Photovoltaic Inverter:
			- Low information; limited economic resources; High reliability problem. 
			- Additional sensors uneconomical
	- Predictive Maintenance, a critical element in optimizing the industry
		- What is predictive maintenance, formal definition
		- Where does it sit in the wider maintenance tasks
		- What does it offer?
			- Empowerment of maintenance regimes. Optimized outputs, lower replacement costs. Being able to plan against operational hazards rather than being at their mercy. 
		- Use cases
			- Residual lifetime estimation, fault identification
		- Requirements for a system
			- Data Requirements: Failure history, maintenance history, usage history, device attributes (context) 
			- Temporal data vs static data
			- (maybe) Feature engineering
	- Photovoltaic Inverter Context
		- Demonstrate this industry doesn't quite meet the requirements for such a system, good old edge cases.
		- Smaller quantities of accurate temporal data (except energy output)
		- Abundance of static data
		- Exogenous temporal data, (like weather) but not at the same unit of analysis, usually quite noisy.
	- Data Generation 
		- Introduce data structure, variables, what they are meant to represent.
		- Show how the context steers the choice of variables.
		- Aim to give a realistic (not pessimistic) level of data found at today's photovoltaic plants
	- Justification of Modeling Choice
		- Numerous ways to tackle this kind of problem.
		- Given the context:
			- Choose to focus on Bayesian time-to-event analysis.
			- Estimate residual lifetime of an inverter
			- Foundation: accurately predict the remaining lifetime of the device by explaining as much of the variation within the data as possible.
4. Methods
	- Reliability Analysis
	- Censoring
	- Accelerated Failure Time Model
	- Frailty & Hierarchical Model
	- Estimation (HMC and Gibbs)
	- Model Selection
		- Handling unbalanced data
5. Analysis
	- The scenarios
		- Simple homogenous system (same model, same plant)
		- Stratification by Model and Site
			- Hierarchical Modeling and Frailty
6. Extensions (Optional)
	- Time-Dependent Covariates
	- Time Varying Effects
	- Improved Baseline Hazard Estimation (Gaussian / Dirchlet Process)
7. Conclusion
