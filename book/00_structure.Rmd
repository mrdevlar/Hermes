## General Structure

1. Introduction
	- General Summary of entire thesis
2. Domain
	- Intro: 
	- Energy mix is important!
		- Fed by global demands
		- Severe consequences to fossil fuel dependency
			- Local:
				- air ([Beijing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/22/beijing-raises-red-alert-threshold-for-air-pollution-warning)) and groundwater ([Parker County, Texas](http://europe.newsweek.com/fracking-wells-tainting-drinking-water-texas-and-pennsylvania-study-finds-270735?rm=eu)) pollution
				- [oil spills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_spills)
				- [destabilization of regions rich in fossil fuels](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/oil-fuels-war-terrorists-isis-climate-movement-peace-cop-21)
			- Global:

		- Continued global demand for the next century
			- Mainly in electricity
			- Demand from the developing world
		- *Segway:* Alternative energy production which is based on renewable resources is the key to reducing these socio-economic and ecological consequences. 
			- An increasing number of alternatives are being developed. 
			- Solar, Wind, Tidal, Geothermal, Fusion.
			- [Along with Wind, Solar appears to be the most likely to become viable alternatives in the next decade.](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/technology-roadmap-solar-photovoltaic-energy---2014-edition.html)
		- The contribution of solar energy to global energy supplies is not limited by resource availability
	- Solar Industry
		- ["The amount of solar radiation intercepted by the earth is more than three orders of magnitude higher than global annual use"](http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf)
		- Rather these factors are key:	
		- The availability of low cost technologies to convert solar to electricity or hydrogen
		- of effective energy storage technology
		- high efficiency end use technologies <!-- see above ref 163 -->
		- Central to these factors in continued technological innovation. 
			- [Better energy absorbing technologies that make use of innovative nano-materials continue to evolve.](http://europe.newsweek.com/indoor-solar-cells-made-possible-moth-eye-graphene-breakthrough-430827)
		- Costs associated with photovoltaic power continue to drop, from [$4 a watt in 2008 to $0.80 in 2014](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2014/09/30/the-rise-of-solar/)
		- Part of that drop is improvements in technology which are able to capture an increasing amount of photovoltaic radiation.
		- Yet, much of the success of solar energy production thus far has been driven by a favorable regulatory environment and government subsidies.
			- Technology improves, but is still below the threshold of self-reliance
		- The economic viability of photovoltaic projects is still questionable, as solar companies do go bankrupt. 
			- Note big bankruptcies. Solandro <!-- Find that slashdot story about the large photovoltaic power company going bankrupt -->
		- There are other ways to optimize yields and boost the profitability of solar companies than improvements underlying technology.
		- Reliability is a big challenge in the photovoltaic area. 
			- Insert metrics about failure
		- Predictive maintenance is one solution to the reliability problem.
		
	- Predictive Maintenance, a critical element in optimizing the industry
		- What is predictive maintenance, formal definition
		- Where does it sit in the wider maintenance tasks
		- What does it offer?
			- Empowerment of maintenance regimes. Optimized outputs, lower replacement costs. Being able to plan against operational hazards rather than being at their mercy. 
		- Use cases
			- Residual lifetime estimation, fault identification
		- Requirements for a system
			- Data Requirements: Failure history, maintenance history, usage history, device attributes (context) 
			- Temporal data vs static data
			- (maybe) Feature engineering
	- Photovoltaic Inverter Context
		- Demonstrate this industry doesn't quite meet the requirements for such a system, good old edge cases.
		- Smaller quantities of accurate temporal data (except energy output)
		- Abundance of static data
		- Exogenous temporal data, (like weather) but not at the same unit of analysis, usually quite noisy.
	- Data Generation 
		- Introduce data structure, variables, what they are meant to represent.
		- Show how the context steers the choice of variables.
		- Aim to give a realistic (not pessimistic) level of data found at today's photovoltaic plants
	- Justification of Modeling Choice
		- Numerous ways to tackle this kind of problem.
		- Given the context:
			- Choose to focus on Bayesian time-to-event analysis.
			- Estimate residual lifetime of an inverter
			- Foundation: accurately predict the remaining lifetime of the device by explaining as much of the variation within the data as possible.
3. Methods
