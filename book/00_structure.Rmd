## General Structure

1. Introduction
	- General Summary of entire thesis
2. Domain
	- Intro: Energy is important!
		- Severe consequences to fossil fuel dependency
			- Ecological
				- Oil spills due to transport
				- Strip Mining
				- Air and Groundwater pollution through byproducts of production
				- Global climate change
					- Ocean Acidification
					- Rising Sea Levels
					- Crop Failure
			- Socio-economic
				- Mass migration
				- Destabilization of regions rich in fossil fuels.
				- [The carbon bubble](http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/08/can-world-economy-survive-without-fossil-fuels)
		- *Segway:* Alternative energy production which is based on renewable resources is the key to reducing these socio-economic and ecological consequences. 
			- An increasing number of alternatives are being developed. 
			- Solar, Wind, Tidal, Geothermal, Fusion.
			- [Along with Wind, Solar appears to be the most likely to become viable alternatives in the next decade.](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/technology-roadmap-solar-photovoltaic-energy---2014-edition.html)
	- Solar Industry 
		- Costs associated with photovoltaic power continue to drop, from [$4 a watt in 2008 to $0.80 in 2014](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2014/09/30/the-rise-of-solar/)
		- Yet despite this rosy outlook, much of the success of solar energy production thus far has been driven by a favorable regulatory environment and government subsidies.
		- The economic viability of photovoltaic projects is still questionable, as is solar companies
			- Note big bankruptcies. Solandro
		- Industry driven by shrinking subsidies for the last decade
		- Requirement to optimize operations as much as possible given the limited resources at their disposal 
		- Photovoltaic Inverter:
			- Low information; limited economic resources; High reliability problem. 
			- Additional sensors uneconomical
	- Predictive Maintenance, a critical element in optimizing the industry
		- What is predictive maintenance, formal definition
		- Where does it sit in the wider maintenance tasks
		- What does it offer?
			- Empowerment of maintenance regimes. Optimized outputs, lower replacement costs. Being able to plan against operational hazards rather than being at their mercy. 
		- Use cases
			- Residual lifetime estimation, fault identification
		- Requirements for a system
			- Data Requirements: Failure history, maintenance history, usage history, device attributes (context) 
			- Temporal data vs static data
			- (maybe) Feature engineering
	- Photovoltaic Inverter Context
		- Demonstrate this industry doesn't quite meet the requirements for such a system, good old edge cases.
		- Smaller quantities of accurate temporal data (except energy output)
		- Abundance of static data
		- Exogenous temporal data, (like weather) but not at the same unit of analysis, usually quite noisy.
	- Data Generation 
		- Introduce data structure, variables, what they are meant to represent.
		- Show how the context steers the choice of variables.
		- Aim to give a realistic (not pessimistic) level of data found at today's photovoltaic plants
	- Justification of Modeling Choice
		- Numerous ways to tackle this kind of problem.
		- Given the context:
			- Choose to focus on Bayesian time-to-event analysis.
			- Estimate residual lifetime of an inverter
			- Foundation: accurately predict the remaining lifetime of the device by explaining as much of the variation within the data as possible.
3. Methods
	- Reliability Analysis
	- Censoring
	- Accelerated Failure Time Model
	- Frailty & Hierarchical Model
	- Estimation (HMC and Gibbs)
	- Model Selection
		- Handling unbalanced data
4. Analysis
	- The scenarios
		- Simple homogenous system (same model, same plant)
		- Stratification by Model and Site
			- Hierarchical Modeling and Frailty
5. Extensions (Optional)
	- Time-Dependent Covariates
	- Time Varying Effects
	- Improved Baseline Hazard Estimation (Gaussian / Dirchlet Process)
6. Conclusion
