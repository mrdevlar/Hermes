## General Structure

1. Introduction
	- General Summary of entire thesis
2. Predictive Maintenance
	- What is? Details.
3. Domain Knowledge - Photovoltaic Inverter
	- Low information, limited economic resources
	- High reliability problem
4. Methods
	- Reliability Analysis
	- Censoring
	- Accelerated Failure Time Model
	- Frailty & Hierarchical Model
	- Estimation (HMC and Gibbs)
	- Model Selection
5. Analysis
	- The scenarios
		- Simple homogenous system (same model, same plant)
		- Stratification by Model and Site
			- Hierarchical Modeling and Frailty
6. Extensions (Optional)
	- Time-Dependent Covariates
	- Time Varying Effects
	- Improved Baseline Hazard Estimation (Gaussian / Dirchlet Process)
7. Conclusion
