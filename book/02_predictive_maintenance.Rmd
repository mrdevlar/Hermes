# Predictive Maintenance
	- What is? Details.

Central motivation:
- maintenance tasks are costly
- repair and replacement leads to downtime and decreased output

<!-- Introduce and define Maintenance  -->
Predictive maintenance has long been a goal in reliability analysis. As its name suggests, predictive maintenance refers to a set of processes designed to determine the condition of operational equipment in order to determine when maintenance should be performed. <!-- CITEHERE --> In other words, it is a set of tools to predict when an industrial device may require support to keep it operational. 

Underlying this definition is the practicality that maintenance is a substantial business expense for many organizations. The knowledge of how to correctly allocate maintenance resources ensures optimal operation as well as reducing costs and downtime.

- Subset of preventative maintenance
- Versus corrective maintenance and replacement

Predictive maintenance is a sub process in the broader field. 


<!-- 
- Considerations for how deal with data recording, what to record and why?
	- Failure autopsy, sensors or maintenance testing
	- Continuous monitoring (economically impractical)
	- Hazards of lab testing leading to accelerated failure

- Define a Failure Mode
	- State why it is important for Failure Modes to be separated
	- Use of competing risk models when multiple failure methods occur.
	- Fit one model per failure mode
		- May ignore the dependency among failure modes

The idea being that maintenance as a task incurs costs, and such processes can be used to only perform the task when it is required.
