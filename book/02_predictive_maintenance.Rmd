# Predictive Maintenance

2. Predictive Maintenance
	- What is? Details.
```

Predictive maintenance has long been a goal in reliability analysis. As its name suggests, predictive maintenance refers to a set of processes designed to determine the condition of operational equipment in order to determine when maintenance should be performed. 

Central motivation:
- maintenance tasks are costly
- repair and replacement leads to downtime and decreased output

Contextualize predictive maintenance in the framework of general maintenance strategies.
- Subset of preventative maintenance
- Versus corrective maintenance and replacement


The central motivation being that these tasks incur costs and thus should only 
The idea being that maintenance as a task incurs costs, and such processes can be used to only perform the task when it is required. 



- Considerations for how deal with data recording, what to record and why?
	- Failure autopsy, sensors or maintenance testing
	- Continuous monitoring (economically impractical)
	- Hazards of lab testing leading to accelerated failure

- Define a Failure Mode
	- State why it is important for Failure Modes to be separated
	- Use of competing risk models when multiple failure methods occur.
	- Fit one model per failure mode
		- May ignore the dependency among failure modes
