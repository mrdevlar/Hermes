# 2. Predictive Maintenance
#	- What is? Details.
```

- Considerations for how deal with data recording, what to record and why?
	- Failure autopsy, sensors or maintenance testing
	- Continuous monitoring (economically impractical)
	- Hazards of lab testing leading to accelerated failure

- Define a Failure Mode
	- State why it is important for Failure Modes to be separated
	- Use of competing risk models when multiple failure methods occur.
	- Fit one model per failure mode
		- May ignore the dependency among failure modes
