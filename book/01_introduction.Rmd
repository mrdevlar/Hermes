# Intended Audience

In the author's view, good academic literature is of the type takes a complex topic and makes it accessible to a broader audience. The intended audience of this thesis is not an expert in statistics, rather a general practitioner in the area of predictive maintenance or reliability analysis. Therefore, there is an emphasis on the building of intuition and understanding of the underlying models likely at the expense of rigor and formality. 

Yet, a certain degree of mathematical development is required to understand this text. Recommended is an understanding of of the calculus of probability at the level of Blitzstein and Huang **REFHERE** as well as a first course on Bayesian linear models at the level of McElreath **REFHERE**. 

To ensure that rigor, an extensive list of references and resources are made available in each chapter, dubbed "Extended Reading". These resources elucidate many of the technical aspects of the modeling process that are beyond the scope of this text.









## Introduction Notes 
 - You hate writing introductions, but you still have to, and it still has to catch the attention of your audience and communicate clearly the priorities of the thesis. It doesn't have to be as thick as you think it does though. 
 - Make sure to clearly provide a structure for the remaining document. 
 - There is no need to justify any of the choices, do that within the text.
 - Event-history analysis vs signal processing



## Introduction Scraps


The predominant preoccupation in the preventative maintenance field is in dealing with high dimensional data that is increasingly being captured by an ever greater number of sensors built into industrial equipment. 

While the methods demonstrated in this thesis are applicable in those circumstances, we acknowledge instead a less examined but equally plentiful context in which to perform maintenance. That of information scarcity.

While sensors are increasingly cheap and plentiful, they are still expensive in absolute terms. No product developer of sound mind would argue for the inclusion of a sensors in a t-shirt to prevent stitching failure. The sensors would vastly increase the production cost of the original product. Yet, this kind of scenario is found throughout industry. We want to infer the reliability and predict the failure of objects that do not have extensive sensor information associated with them.

Maintenance is not sexy, but it is essential. 
Yet ire is 

Maintenance is the backbone of the modern industrialized world. It's not sexy, but it is essential. Few sing the praises of the multitude of technicians which are responsible for ensuring trains run on time, computer systems remain online or that bridges are structurally sound. 

The purpose of this thesis is to making the lives of technicians a bit easier by describing and analyzing methods of performing predictive maintenance in areas with limited data. 

As data is a limited resource in these examples, what data is captured and how it is stored and utilized becomes a primary element in the success of preventative maintenance in these context. 



Reliability analysis, in some form or other, has been a foundational part of the practice of statstics for almost as long as the field has existed.
