## Introduction

Time-to-event analysis/footnote{also known as survival analysis, reliability analysis and event history analysis} concerns itself with the modeling of the expected duration of time until an object experiences a well-defined event. This event should is a transition between a finite number of possible states, such as from functional to broken, or alive to dead.\cite{Andersen1992} 

To be able to model the time until these transitions, we require precision in describing our phenomenon, and for that, we require mathematics. The following section describes the mathematical narrative that underly the construction, manipulation and estimation of time-to-event models.

We begin with a description of the basic functions required to understand the models, their role in defining time-to-event distributions and their relationship to one another.

## Time-to-Event Functions

Let us define $T$, a continuous non-negative random variable ($T \ge 0, T \in \mathbb{R}$) with an unknown distribution representing the time until a well-defined event. We can then define $t$ to be the realization of this random variable at a specific point in time.

A familiar way of describing a probability distribution is to use probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf). The pdf is the relative likelihood of a random variable taking a particular realization.

$$f(t) = \Pr(T = t)$$

The cdf defines the probability that a random variable will take on a value less than or equal to some realization. Thus, it defines a range across a random variable. In our case: 

$$F(t) = \Pr(T \le t) = \int^t_0 f(x) dx $$

In our application, the cdf of $T$ may not be particularly interesting as we are interested in random variables that take on values greater than some realization. Fortunately, by definition, a random variable must sum to one, we can find the complement the cdf by subtraction. 

$$S(t) = P(T \ge t) = 1 - F(t) = \int^{\infty}_t f(x) dx$$

This gives us the survival function which is the probability that our well-defined event occurs after a specific point in time. Of course, if the event occurs after a specific point in time, the object under study must not have experienced the event up to that point. Thus, the survival function gets its name from the fact that it provides the probability that the object has survived up to a particular point in time. 

As the survival function is the complement of the cumulative distribution function, it inherits the properties from the cdf. It is monotonically decreasing, with $S(0) = 1$ and $S(\infty) = \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}S(t) = 0$. This formalizes the notion that when the event in question is death, in the beginning all devices are operational, but given a long enough time frame all devices eventually fail. 

It is generally true that any pdf can be expressed as a derivative of its cdf, and the survival function also provides a route back to the pdf. The negative derivative of the survival function returns the pdf. Such that the pdf can be redefined as:

$$f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\Pr(t \le T < t + \Delta t) }{\Delta t} = \frac{d F(t)}{dt} = - \frac{d S(t)}{dt}$$

As we now have a function that can describe the probability of survival up to a specific point, but what if we want to know whether or not something survives into the next point in time? 

**@TODO**: Better segway between survival and hazard function

$$h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{P(t \le T < t + \Delta t | T \ge t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$

This is the hazard function, it defines the rate of survival as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, or rephrased it is the instantaneous rate of an event, given that the event has not yet occurred. It should be stressed, that this function does not return a probability, rather a rate ( $\frac{P}{\Delta t}$ ), and thus can take on values greater than 1. 

If we integrate the hazard from our starting point until a specific point in time, we return a cumulative hazard function. 

$$H(t) = \int^t_0 h(u) du$$

The cumulative hazard is the amount of times we would expect to observe our well-defined event over a given period of time, assuming that event were repeatable. 


## Relationships between Functions


The relationships are important yadda yadda.













### Left-overs


Reliability analysis, in some form or other, has been a foundational part of the practice of statstics for almost as long as the field has existed. 



Two features distinguish time-to-event analysis from most standard statistical procedures, namely non-normally distributed errors and incomplete observation.



The first feature that distinguishes time-to-event analysis from traditional statistical methods is a lack of normally distributed errors.\cite{Guo2010} Time is always positive quantity, this alone should invalidate the normal error model. However, more compelling is the notion that the rate of survival distribution does not necessarily have to have a single mode. For example, when examining the survival time of individuals following a difficult surgical procedure, one would expect to see two groups of deaths. One shortly after the procedure, possibly due to complications, and a second group of deaths long after if the reason for the surgery reoccurs. This type of bimodality is unable to be properly modeled using standard OLS regression. 

The second distinguishing feature is incomplete observation, or censoring, which obscures the time until an event occurs. For example, when analyzing the time until failure of an industrial device, it is often impractical to wait until all the devices in the population have failed before drawing conclusions. Therefore, the data we utilize gives us only a partial view of the duration until the event occurs in the population. Censoring comes in various classes and types, depending on the segment of time is unobserved. Right censoring is the most common class, and refers to the situation where the event is observed only if it occurs prior to some pre-specified time.\cite{Klein2003} In our case, we only observe a photovoltaic inverter failure if it has occurred in the past. Our prespecified time, is this moment, and all functioning inverters are thus right censored.
