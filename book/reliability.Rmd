# Basic Functions

Let us define $T$, a continuous non-negative random variable ($T \ge 0, T \in \mathbb{R}$) with an unknown distribution representing the time until a well-defined event. We can then define $t$ to be the realization of this random variable at a particular time.

A familiar way of describing a probability distribution is to use probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf). The pdf is the relative likelihood of a random variable taking a particular realization.

$$f(t) = \Pr(T = t)$$

The cdf defines the probability that a random variable will take on a value less than or equal to some realization. Thus, it defines a range across a random variable. In our case: 

$$F(t) = \Pr(T \le t) = \int^t_0 f(x) dx $$

In our application, the cdf of $T$ may not be particularly interesting as we are interested in random variables that take on values greater than some realization. Fortunately, by definition, a random variable must sum to one, we can find the complement the cdf by subtraction. 

$$S(t) = P(T \ge t) = 1 - F(t) = \int^{\infty}_t f(x) dx$$

This gives us the Survival function which is the probability that our well-defined event occurs after a specific point in time. Of course, if the event occurs after a specific point in time, the object under study must not have experienced the event up to that point. Thus, the Survival function gets its name from the fact that it provides the probability that the object has survived up to a particular point in time. 

As the Survival function is the complement of the cumulative distribution function, it inherits the properties from the cdf. It is monotonically decreasing, with $S(0) = 1$ and $S(\infty) = \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}S(t) = 0$. This formalizes the self-evident notion that at the beginning of observation all devices are operational, and given a long enough time frame all devices will eventually fail.
