# Censoring and Truncation

- Censoring is missing compared to Truncation which is omission
- One of the unique aspects of time-to-event analysis is that data does not always contain an observation of the event in question. 
- Though really it is the lack of normally distributed errors. 
- Data in this case should be right censored.
	- It may also be left-truncated, though that can be avoided with careful data management.

- While truncation does not feature explicitly in our case-study, it should be noted that it can appear due to poor data entry practices. Systems administrators should be careful to avoid truncation in their data inadvertantly. For example, if a device is dead on arrival, it is easy to simply omit it from the records rather than take the time to input a failure at t = 0. However, the omission of such records induces truncation, which biases the estimation of the underlying survival functions.

- May provide how one works correctly with right censored or truncated distributions.

As stated earlier, censoring is a defining element of survival analysis. Yet, so far we have only explored functions that exist in complete information. In real world applications, we are often unable to wait long enough to see all devices fail and have complete information. Thus, we must infer from what we have but to do this we require a mechanism to accommodate those lifetimes that are not yet fully observed.

The solution is to create a binary random variable ( $\delta_i$) to account for whether a failure is observed and a random variable ($Y_i$) which combines our observation of the time with whether that failure is observed.

Let $T$ denote the lifetime of a device and $C$ a random censor time. Every device has a lifetime $T_i$ and a censor time $C_i$ and for every device we observe a pair ($Y_i, \delta_i$) where:

$$  Y_i = \min(T_i,C_i) \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \delta_i = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1 \text{ if } T_i \le C_i\\ 0 \text{ if } C_i < T_i \end{matrix}\right.$$

It should be noted that the preceding description applies to 

random censoring which is common in observational data like that used in this analysis. However, reliability studies also make use of different schemes for

There are three main modes of censoring, Type I, Type II and random censoring. 

In reliability studies Type I and Type II censoring is common. However, as we are attempting
