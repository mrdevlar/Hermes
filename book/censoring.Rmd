# Censoring and Truncation

  - One of the unique aspects of time-to-event analysis is that data does not always contain an observation of the event in question. 
  - Data in this case should be right censored. 
  - While truncation does not feature explicitly in our case-study, it should be noted that it can appear due to poor data entry practices. Systems administrators should be careful to avoid truncation in their data inadvertantly. For example, if a device is dead on arrival, it is easy to simply omit it from the records rather than take the time to input a failure at t = 0. However, the omission of such records induces truncation, which biases the estimation of the underlying survival functions.
